I design and develop web-based data visualization tools to support student learning, as part of the UBC Learning Analytics project. I enjoy working with data and spend a lot of time writing React & D3, as well as pure JavaScript. I'm interested in progressive web applications, web performance, and functional programming.

I'm very active on [GitHub](https://github.com/justin0022).
