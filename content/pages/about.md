## Software
I work at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) on the [Learning Analytics project](https://learninganalytics.ubc.ca/). I design and develop web-based data visualization tools to support student learning such as [My Learning Analytics](https://github.com/tl-its-umich-edu/my-learning-analytics), using React, D3, and GraphQL. 

I believe in developing in the open and my most of my projects are open-sourced on [GitHub](https://github.com/justin0022).

## Life
Outside of work, you can usually find me trail running, biking, climbing, and generally running around the glorious mountains of Vancouver's north shore.

In 2019, I gained 51,250m of elevation on foot and 23,227m on bike, which is equivalent to climbing Everest from sea level 8.4 times.
