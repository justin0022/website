North Vancouver is a city nestled in between the Pacific ocean and the North Shore mountains, which marks the very southern end of the vast Coast Mountain range that extends nearly uninterrupted some 1600km north to the Yukon. Having lived here for the past 6 years, I've had ample time to reflect on the impact that my proximity to the mountains in particular have had on my life.

I live in Lower Lonsdale (affectionally called "LoLo" by the locals), close to the Londsale Quay, where the seabus ferries passengers to and from downtown Vancouver across the Burrard Inlet, a 12 minute crossing with breathtaking views all around.

Despite LoLo's proximity to downtown Vancouver, the mountains are near also. I've "home-bagged" at least a couple of peaks, a term I just invented for climbing to the top of a mountain from one's place of residence, relying only on one's own propulsion (i.e. no e-bikes or helicopters).

The most memorable home-bag was [Mount Bishop](https://www.outdoorvancouver.ca/featured-hiking-trail-mount-bishop/) from last July, which the website linked describes (not inaccurately) as a "rarely-traveled and very challenging hike". Starting from my home, I biked down to the Pacific ocean to dip my finger in for the water-bag (ocean to top of peak, of course), then [biked 20km](https://www.strava.com/activities/2568538853) to the Seymour Reservoir. After locking up my bike, I hiked up the [steep route up to Bishop](https://www.strava.com/activities/2568539334) with a brave friend, passing through endless old growth trees until we hit the alpine, at which point we were rewarded with spectacular views of the Fannin range framed by wildflowers and juicy mountain blueberries and huckleberries to munch on.

> I want you to imagine you are driving north, across the Lions Gate Bridge, and the sky is steely gray and the sugar-dusted mountains loom blackly in the distance. Imagine what lies behind those mountains — realize that there are only more mountains — mountains until the North Pole, mountains until the end of the world, mountains taller than a thousand me’s, mountains taller than a thousand you’s… Here is where civilization ends: here is where time ends and where eternity begins. Here is what Lions Gate Bridge is: one last grand gesture of beauty, of charm, and of grace before we enter the hinterlands, before the air becomes too brittle and too cold to breathe, before we enter that place where life becomes harsh, where we must become animals in order to survive. - [Douglas Coupland](https://www.coupland.com/)
